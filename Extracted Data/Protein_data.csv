Reference proteome","The poly-Gln region of HTT is highly polymorphic (10 to 35 repeats) in the normal population and is expanded to about 36-120 repeats in Huntington disease patients. The repeat length usually increases in successive generations, but contracts also on occasion. The adjacent poly-Pro region is also polymorphic and varies between 7-12 residues. Polyglutamine expansion leads to elevated susceptibility to apopain cleavage and likely result in accelerated neuronal apoptosis (PubMed:"
