Alleles corresponding in size to a 4 (PER3.4) and 5 (PER3.5) repeats have been described. The sequence shown is that of allele PER3.5. In most populations around 10% of individuals are homozygous for the 5-repeat (PER3.5), whereas approximately 50% are homozygous for the 4-repeat (PER3.4). In some populations in Papua New Guinea the prevalence of the various genotypes appears to be reversed. These repeats and polymorphism are not present in non-primate mammals. Homozygosity for PER3.5 is more likely to show morning preference, whereas homozygosity for the PER3.4 associates with evening preferences. PER3.5 homozygous show vulnerability to sleep loss with a greater cognitive decline in response to total sleep deprivation (PubMed:"

It is a multifactorial disease characterized by red, scaly skin lesions that are usually found on the scalp, elbows, and knees, and may be associated with severe arthritis. The lesions are caused by hyperproliferative keratinocytes and infiltration of inflammatory cells into the dermis and epidermis. The usual age of onset of psoriasis is between 15 and 30 years, although it can present at any age. Association of HCR with psoriasis seem to be due to linkage disequilibrium with Cw*06:02 (PubMed:"
